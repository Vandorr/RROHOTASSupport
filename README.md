## FAQ

**What the hell is IOTE checkbox?**\
Interact Only on The Edge - If you check it, it will only interact with the game when your HOTAS axis reach the desired (Value top or Value bottom) value. I use it for the reverser


**Requirements if you want to build from the source code:**
- Delphi 10.3
- DevExpress components (TcxGrid, input fields)
- Winsoft's DirectX Joystick Component
